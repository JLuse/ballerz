# Fantasy Football Analytics Tool

A machine learning tool that predicts whether NFL players will over- or underperform their weekly fantasy projections.

## Project Goals

1. **MVP**: Build a baseline model that predicts over/under performance vs projections
2. **Data Pipeline**: Ingest and clean historical fantasy football data
3. **Model Evaluation**: Compare predictions against actual outcomes
4. **Future**: Add AI assistant for prediction explanations and start/sit decisions

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Sample Data (Quick Start)
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train with sample data: `python train_baseline.py`
3. Make predictions: `python predict.py`

### Option 2: Real NFL Data (Recommended)
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train with real NFL data: `python train_with_real_data.py`
3. Explore the data: `python -m src.data.nfl_data_integration`

## Development Approach

- Start simple with one position (RB)
- Use 2-3 seasons of historical data
- Focus on binary classification (over/under perform)
- Build incrementally with testable components
- Learn and iterate based on results

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Set up data collection pipeline
2. âœ… Create baseline model for RBs
3. âœ… Add feature engineering
4. âœ… Integrate real NFL data
5. ðŸ”„ Expand to other positions (WR, QB, TE)
6. ðŸ”„ Add opponent defensive stats
7. ðŸ”„ Include weather and injury data
8. ðŸ”„ Build AI assistant for explanations
