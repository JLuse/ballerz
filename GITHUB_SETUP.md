# GitHub Setup Guide

## 🚀 Pushing Your Fantasy Football Analytics Project to GitHub

Your project is now ready to be pushed to GitHub! Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Repository name**: `ballerz`
   - **Description**: `Machine learning tool that predicts NFL player over/under performance vs fantasy projections`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/JLuse/ballerz.git

# Set the main branch as default
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Everything is Working

1. **Check your repository** on GitHub.com
2. **Verify all files are there** (should be ~23 files)
3. **Check that large files are NOT there** (data files, model files, NFL-Data folder)

## 📁 What Will Be Pushed to GitHub

### ✅ **Included Files:**
- All source code (`src/` directory)
- Configuration files (`config/`)
- Documentation (`README.md`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`, `REAL_DATA_ANALYSIS.md`)
- Requirements (`requirements.txt`)
- Tests (`tests/`)
- Notebooks (`notebooks/`)
- Training scripts (`train_baseline.py`, `train_with_real_data.py`)
- Prediction script (`predict.py`)

### ❌ **Excluded Files (via .gitignore):**
- Data files (`data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, `*.csv`, `*.json`)
- Model files (`models/*.joblib`, `models/*.pkl`)
- Large external data (`NFL-Data/` repository)
- Virtual environment (`.venv/`)
- Cache files (`__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`)
- OS files (`.DS_Store`)

```

## 🔧 After Pushing to GitHub

### For You:
1. **Share the repository** with others
2. **Add collaborators** if working with a team
3. **Set up GitHub Pages** for documentation (optional)
4. **Add issues and milestones** for future development

### For Others:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/JLuse/ballerz.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run with sample data**: `python train_baseline.py`
4. **Run with real data**: `python train_with_real_data.py`

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Data Files:**
- The large data files are NOT included in the repository
- Users will need to download the NFL data separately or use sample data
- Consider adding instructions for data download in the README

### **Model Files:**
- Trained models are NOT included (they can be large)
- Users will need to train their own models
- This is actually good practice for ML projects

### **Environment:**
- Virtual environment is excluded
- Users should create their own environment
- `requirements.txt` provides all necessary dependencies

## 🎉 Success!

Once you've completed these steps, your fantasy football analytics tool will be live on GitHub and ready to share with the world!
